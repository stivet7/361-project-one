    <h1>Welcome</h1>
<p1>Hello, my name is Stive Tenorio. I am a third-year Information Technology Management student enrolled at Illinois Institute of Technology.
    This is welcome page is one of the three pages for project one for my ITMD-361 web development class. I've had some experiece with HTML programming
    in high school, but that was only about two weeks of webpage work. I hope to learn more about web development through the progress made with this project,
    the comments and critiques I'll recieve from my classmates and from the class as a whole. Thank you for reading this.</p1>
